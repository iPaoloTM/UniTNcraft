A 2D minimal version of Minecraft: includes a Map, a Furnace and an Inventory (all working)

# Features
Graphical UI:
  Click on the map to pick up a block and put it into the inventory
  Click on the inventory to put a block into the furnace (first you need the fuel!)
  Click on the furnace to smelt the input and get the output, it will be put back into the inventory (and decrease the fuel power)
